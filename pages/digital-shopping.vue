          If you have an Books2Grow account, after your purchase you’ll see a download
          link beside the product you purchased.
        </p>
        <p>
          Downloads are available once your payment is confirmed. If you paid with PayPal
          or a credit card on Books2Grow, confirmation might take a few minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ll also send you a download notification email separate from any transaction
          notification emails you receive from Books2Grow and/or PayPal.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're unsure if you've purchased a Digital Item, you can always go back to
          the listing page. If it is a digital download, you should see an "Instant
          Download" message on the images for the item.
        </p>

          I purchased a digital item, but I don't have an Books2Grow account.
        </h2>
        <p>
          If you checked out as a guest, you'll find a link to download your purchase in
          the receipt email that was sent to you after purchase.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading-secondary">
          I can’t seem to find my download notification email.

        <p>
          First, check your spam or junk inbox. If you use Gmail, also check your
          <em>Social</em> and <em>Promotions</em> tabs. If it’s not there, add
          <strong>info@books2grow.com</strong> to your address book or safe list.

        <p>For now, you can still get to your file using the directions below.</p>

          Can I access my digital purchases from within my account?
        </h2>
        <p>To access your digital files from your account:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Sign in to
            <a href="http://www.books2grow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
              >Books2Grow.com</a
            >
            and go to <strong>Your</strong> <strong>account</strong>.
          </li>

          <li>
            Next to the order, select<strong> Download Files</strong>. This goes to the
            Downloads page for all the files attached to your order.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          There are generally no limits for when or how many times you can download a
          file. In most cases, you can access a file any time on your Purchases page,
          provided the transaction hasn't been canceled or removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your payment is still processing, the<strong> Download Files</strong>
          button will be gray.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading-secondary">I’m having trouble downloading my files.</h2>
        <p>
          If nothing happens when you click the download links, it’s possible that there’s
          an issue with your web browser. Please disable any non-standard add-ons or
          toolbars that you’ve installed and try again.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your computer states that the file has been corrupted, delete the file and
          try downloading it again. If you still can't open the file, please contact the

          If you’re unable to locate a download link on your Purchases page, it’s possible
          that the seller prefers to email files directly and has sold your file as part
          of a “physical item” listing.
